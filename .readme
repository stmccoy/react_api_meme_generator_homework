First project that I completed using react and the fetch api. The class I was in had a passion for programmer memes so I decided to create a project that would draw meme data from the subreddit r/programmerhumor and display each meme one at a time. A big problem that I faced with this app was that not every post in the subreddit had a picture associated with it, which caused my app to fail when these posts were reached. I managed to get around this by adding an error check for the picture element of the app, which would trigger a click event on the next meme button if the picture failed to load. This meant that any posts without a picture would be skipped. Overall I was very happy with how this app turned out. If was to make improvements moving forward, I would look into having an option to change subreddit, allowing it to have multiple meme categories. 

To run the app type 'npm run' in the src folder
