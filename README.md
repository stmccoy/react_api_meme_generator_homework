First project that I completed using React with Javascript's fetch method for receiving API data. The class I was in had a passion for programming based memes so I decided to create an app that would draw meme data from the subreddit r/programmerhumor and display each meme one at a time. A big problem that I faced with this app was that not every post in the subreddit had a picture associated with it, which caused my app to fail when these posts were reached. I managed to get around this by adding an error check for the picture element of the app, which would trigger the click handler function on the 'Get New Meme' button if the picture failed to load. This meant that any posts without a picture would be skipped as triggering the click handler function effectively simulated a click event from the user, without them actually pressing anything. Overall I was very happy with how this app turned out. If I was to make one improvement moving forward, I would look into having an option to change subreddit, allowing the app to have multiple meme categories. However, as a developer I'm quite happy to just enjoy the programmer ones.

To run the app type 'npm run' in the src folder, after ensuring react is intalled on your computer.
